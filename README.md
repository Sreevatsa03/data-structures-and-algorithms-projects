# Data Structures and Algorithms Projects

Repository of every project and assignment I completed in my Post AP Computer Science: Data Structures and Algorithms class, taken during the 2019-2020 school year.

## Projects

### [Graph Analysis](graph_analysis_project)

- Graph analysis with Markov Clustering, Dijkstra's, Kruskal's, Ford Fulkerson, Topological Sort, etc.

### [Analyzing Utility of Radix Sort](radix_sort_project)

- Compare runtimes of quick and radix sort on various types of data, such as random small values, random large values, combined, etc.

### [Postfix Calculator with GUI](calculator_project)

- Created a calculator that performs calculations in postfic, trig functions, and linear regression, and we added GUI using Qt tools

### [Hacking 3D Space Cadet Pinball](pinball_hacking_project)

- Hacked pinball game through hex editing and disassembly to use mouse to move pinball freely, change score at will, etc.

### [Vacuum Simulator](vacuum_simulator_project)

- Implemented simulation of a vacuum finding the shortest path to clean a dirty room, using BFS, A*, etc.

## Assignments
